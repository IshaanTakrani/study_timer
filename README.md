I sometimes have trouble focusing on work. I built this timer to help me with that problem.
It provides a simple, functional, and customizable interface that allows me to keep myself
focued on tasks for set intervals.

The timer utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to function.

## How to use:

To use this timer, simply select any of the preset time intervals `(format: minutes:seconds)`
or select the `other (click me)` button to set a custom time interval `(format: minutes)`.
Press the start/stop button to start and pause the timer, and the timer button to stop the timer
and reset the time to the initial value.
